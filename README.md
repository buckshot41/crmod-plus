# CRMod 2021

Quake1 CRDM and CRCTF in a single server mod, modernized and ported to FTEsv (64bit)

Based on the original [CRMod](https://github.com/jp-grossman/crmod), and [CRCTF](link?) code by JP Grossman.

## Changes from the original Source (TODO)

- link a diff from the CRMOD repo
- highlight key updates / differences

## Compiling the Source (TODO)

- add clear & complete compilation instructions.
  - compiler should probably not be included in the project, but clear steps on how to compile should be.

## Setting up and running a CRMod 2021 server (TODO)

- add clear & complete server setup instructions
  - how do I add custom maps / make maps votable, etc?
